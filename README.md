# titanic-ml-lab

This repository contains my work for the Titanic ML lab.

I haven’t been able to complete Lab 1, so I haven’t even started Lab 2 yet.

I made multiple attempts to complete this lab on the university lab PCs, but consistently ran into environment and dependency issues that prevented the lab from running correctly.

I then restarted the lab from scratch on my personal machine. While this resolved some problems, I still encountered several technical difficulties related to environment setup and package compatibility.

I have done my best to do as much as possible. However, I found the lab document challenging to interpret at certain steps, which contributed to the issues faced during implementation.

I appreciate your understanding and consideration.
